# Prework-Study-Guide

## Description

The Prework-Study-Guide project is my introduction to coding.
I am just starting to learn how to code. I am facinated by technology and this is my first step to learning how tech works on the backend.
I build this project as base so I can refer to as I continue learning, and as I continue learning, I want to develope this project with the new skills I learn. 
This project helped me learn the very basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Though I barely touched the surface, this was the perfect first step to get started into the world of coding. 

## Usage

This study guide contains elementary notes to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. If we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running.
